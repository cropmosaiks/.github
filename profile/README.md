# [CropMOSAIKS:](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects/open-source-pipeline-remote-sensing-crop-yields-under-environmental-change-sub-saharan) An Open Source Pipeline for Remote Sensing of Crop Yields Under Environmental Change in Sub-Saharan Africa

## Purpose

This GitHub organization hosts the code used in a Capstone Project for the Masters of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, University of California Santa Barbara. This project intends to adapt, apply, and extend the MOSAIKS framework described in [Rolf et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24638-z) to encode monthly imagery from the Landsat and Sentinel satellite missions through random convolutional features. THe resulting features will be used to model crop yields. Currently our project is limited by data availability and is restricted to the country of Zambia.  

## What is here?

This organization hosts several repositories including `Featurization` and `Modeling`.
