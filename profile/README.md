# Crop MOSAIKS

Capstone Project for the Masters of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, University of California Santa Barbara. 

This project intends to adapt, apply, and extend the MOSAIKS framework described in ["A Generalizable and Accessible Approach to Machine Learning with Global Satellite Imagery"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24638-z) (Rolf et al 2021<sup>1</sup>) to featurize landsat data.
